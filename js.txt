What is hoisting?
Execution context in javascript.

    Everything in javascript happens inside an Execution context.
    When we run javascript whole code, A global execution context is created.  
    The execution context is created in two phases.
        1)First one is Memory Creation (creation phase) phase.
            In first phase of Memory creation, javascript will allocate memory to all the 
            variable and functions.

        2)second one is code execution phase.


        Note : when we invoked function in js on that time new execution context is created 
               that execution context also have two phases in which first one is memory allocation
               phase and second one is code execution phase. 

        In javascript, return keyword tells the function, just return the control back to the execution context, where
        the function was invoked.

        In javascript, return keyword states that, now return the control of the program, to the place where the 
        function was invoked.

        when whole the function is executed,then whole execution context for that instance of the function will be deleted. 

        Once the javascript done with all it's work, now the program is finished. the whole global execution context
        also deleted. 

What is window?
    Window is a global object which is created along with the global execution context.
    at the global level this keyword takes window object.
