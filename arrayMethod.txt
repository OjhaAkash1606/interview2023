1) Array.at() : The at() method takes an integer value and returns the item at that index.
                For negative value negativeValue + Array.length. 
                
                Calling at() on non-array objects
                The at() method reads the length property of this and calculates the index
                to access.

                Return Undefined

2)Array.concat() : The concat() method is used to merge two or more arrays. This method does 
                   not change the existing arrays, but instead returns a new array.

                Return New Array

3)Array.copyWithin() : The copyWithin() method shallow copies part of an array to another location
                     in the same array and returns it without modifying its length.

4)Array.entries() : The entries() method returns a new Array Iterator object that contains the key/value pairs
                  for each index in the array.         

5)Array.every() : The every() method tests whether all elements in the array pass the test implemented by the 
                  provided function.It returns a Boolean value.                

6)



Array.filter() : The filter() method creates a new array, that array considered value which have filtered down to
just the elements from the given array that pass the test implemented by the provided function.

Array.reduce() : This method returns single value which can be array , object or any data type value.

Array.map() : This method return new modifying array with the same length.
